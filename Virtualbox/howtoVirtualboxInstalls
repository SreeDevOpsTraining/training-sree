How we built a linux machine in virtual box.
  - we have downloaded a virtualbox from website
  - used standard windows method to install the VB in windows

  - we installed virtualbox using VB GUI
  - We also installed Linux box by creating a profile (assigning memory, cpu etc) manually
  - We started Linux machine by choosing appropriate options on Virtualbox GUI/Linux head mode
    - Press I to start installe
    - Choose harddisk to install Linux OS
    - Choose US-English as language
    - Set root password etc.


  Advance method to install all the above is :
  - We choose to install virtualbox by chocolatey or brew for Mac.
  - We choose to install Linux using Packer (more infrastructure as code)

  We stored all our code (ex. packer template) in GitHub repository.
  How
    - we cloned the repo from github to local laptop
    - we changed/created packer template and its dependencies (ks.cfg)
    - we then saved contents (template.json) in git repo using
      - git add --all  (add new or modified contents in git repo)
      - git commit -m "" - save changed contents
      - git push origin master - sends the commited contents to GitHub

  We used rake (as a build tool) to run packer build instead using direct packer commands.
    - rake helped us wrap commands inside rakefile so that we do not have to remember commands.
