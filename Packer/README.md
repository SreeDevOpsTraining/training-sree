We are building packer using rake builder
Rake requirements
1)  we need bundler to be installed - `gem install bundler` (gem executable is part of ruby install)
2) create a Gemfile, is where you specify gems to be installed (refer gemfile for information)
3) bundle install - will read gemfile and install gems specified in that file.
